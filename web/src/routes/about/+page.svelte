		<p>
			Server Radar is a tool that helps you track and visualize the prices of Hetzner servers over
			time. By monitoring auction prices, you can make informed decisions on when to buy and when to
			wait for a better deal.
		</p>

	<h3 class="mb-5 text-lg font-semibold">How It Works</h3>
	<div class="mx-auto mb-5 max-w-4xl text-gray-400">
		<p class="mb-4">
			Every hour, we collect data from the Hetzner auction API, including server model, price,
			location, and other relevant details. This data is stored in our database and used to generate
			graphs and statistics, allowing you to understand trends and make better purchasing decisions.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Data is updated hourly and retained for three months, enabling you to view historical trends
			and make comparisons over time. We also offer tools to filter and search the data, helping you
			find the servers that best meet your needs.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			In addition to auction data, we gather information on server configurations and prices,
			letting you compare average prices for different server types against auction prices. Our
			comparison tool further helps you evaluate how different server prices stack up, so you can
			secure the best deal and save money.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			We also provide statistics on price trends for RAM, SSD, and HDD storage, helping you identify
			trends and determine the optimal time to purchase storage-heavy configurations.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our goal is to equip you with the information needed to secure the best deals on Hetzner
			servers, whether you're seeking a budget option or a high-performance machine.
